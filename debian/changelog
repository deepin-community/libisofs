  * New upstream release
    + Bug fix: Prevent allocation of empty hash tables. Thanks Richard Nolde.
    + Bug fix: Prevent allocation of empty directory children lists.

    + Bug fix: Fixed buffer overflow in demo/demo.c with gesture -iso_read.
               Thanks to Jakub Wilk. (Closes: #774147).

               boundary. This is heavily disliked by the Linux kernel and
               spoils the representation of directories which contain many
               symbolic links.
    + Bug fix: Only 128 bytes of an emerging GPT header block were zeroized.
    + Bug fix: Fixed a typo in message of make install. (Closes: #774140)

    + Increased default weight of El Torito boot catalog to 1 billion.
    + Improved handling of cylinder alignment if the resulting image size is
      not divisible by 2048. Old behavior was to not align. New is to pad up
      by a few blocks of 512 bytes.
    + New API calls iso_image_report_el_torito() and
      iso_image_report_system_area().
    + New API call iso_write_opts_set_appended_as_gpt() and marking of
      appended partitions in GPT if GPT emerges for other reasons.
    + New system area type 6 = DEC Alpha SRM boot sector.
      New API calls iso_image_set_alpha_boot(), iso_image_get_alpha_boot().
      Thanks to Helge Deller.
    + New API object iso_interval_reader. Enabling flag bits for older
      API calls iso_write_opts_set_prep_img(), iso_write_opts_set_efi_bootp(),
